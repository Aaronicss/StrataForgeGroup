      ["Who is responsible", "StrataForge Software Solutions is responsible for the inquiry information described here. For privacy questions or requests, email strataforge.dev@gmail.com."],
      ["Information you provide", "The inquiry form asks for your name and email address, and lets you optionally add your company and project details. Please avoid including sensitive personal information that is not needed for your inquiry."],
      ["How the inquiry form works", "When you submit the form, your browser opens a Gmail compose window and passes the entered details to prepare a draft addressed to strataforge.dev@gmail.com. Google may process those details to create the draft. This website does not send the form contents to a StrataForge server. Nothing is emailed to StrataForge until you review and send the draft. If you use the email-app fallback, your chosen email provider handles the draft and message."],
      ["Why we use inquiry information", "We use information in a message you choose to send to respond to your questions, discuss your requested project, and prepare a proposal. This is to take steps you request before a possible service agreement. If you engage StrataForge, information may also be used to manage that service relationship and related records."],
      ["Sharing and service providers", "StrataForge does not sell inquiry information. Google processes details when your browser opens the Gmail draft, and your email provider processes the message if you send it. The site also loads typography from Google Fonts, which means your browser requests font files from Google. Website hosting providers may process basic connection and security information needed to deliver the website. This source does not configure analytics or advertising trackers."],
      ["Retention and security", "Unsuccessful inquiry messages are generally kept for up to 24 months after the last substantive exchange, then deleted or anonymized. We may keep information longer when a project is active, a legal obligation applies, or it is needed to establish or defend a legal claim. Access is limited to people who need the information for those purposes. No internet transmission or storage method can be guaranteed completely secure."],
      ["Your privacy rights", "Under applicable Philippine privacy law, you may have rights to be informed, access or correct personal information, object to certain processing, request erasure or blocking, request data portability, and lodge a complaint with the National Privacy Commission, subject to applicable requirements and exceptions. Contact strataforge.dev@gmail.com to make a request. We may need to verify your identity before responding."],
